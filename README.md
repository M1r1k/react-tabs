# React-Tabs

## Installing
```bash
$ npm install entwicklerstube/react-tabs
```

### Why the Fork?
The official version of `react-tabs` doesn't support the new react v0.15 version.

### What did you change?
Just configuration, the main problem was some configuration stuff.

### What will happen if they update the official version?
If they fix the problem i will not delete this repo - but make a warning in the head of the README, so please check after a while if you can change back to the official version.

### Examples, Usage, Docs, etc.
Everything beside how to install the package is the same as before, so for more information please checkout the official [react-tabs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tabs) repository.
