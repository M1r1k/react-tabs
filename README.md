# React-Tabs

## Installing
```bash
$ npm install entwicklerstube/react-tabs
```

This is just a fork till the official module supports the react v0.15 version.
Since this repo doesn't change the module itself (that already supports the new react) but changes configuration stuff, so for more information take a look on the original repository:</br>
